        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <div class="biography1">
            <h3> Small Town Beginnings </h3>
            <p> I was born in Northern Michigan and lived in a very small town where there wasn't much to do. My
                graduating class was a whopping 30 students. I was introduced to the internet at a very young age since
                I'm right at the border of the Millenial generation and Gen Z. My older brother designed websites as a
                side hustle and I'd watch him code and would always be interested in what he was doing. Howeverm I did
                not follow that interest initially when I graduated highschool. I attended Michigan State University for
                my undergraduate studies. I started persuing a degree in Anthropology and quickly shifted my degree into
                a focus of political science and philosophy with the intent of attending law school. Life doesn't always
                go the way we intend, however. I found myself doubting what I wanted to do with my life and decided to
                drop out of college. I have worked at a few places since and found myself working at Amazon at the GRR1
                FC.With Amazon's Career Choice, I decided now was a better time than ever to turn that interest in
                software development into a career! </p>

            <h3> Things I Enjoy </h3>
            <p>There are a lot of things I find myself enjoying. With living in Michigan my hobbies vary with the
                seasons. I am outside a LOT in the summer enjoying the sun and our beautiful forests and rivers.
                Camping, hiking, and kayaking are just a couple of the things I get to do when there's no snow on the
                ground. In the winter, I usually squirrel away in my home and spend most of my time gaming and crafting.
            </p>
            <p>Travelling is always something I enjoy a lot and I've been to most of the states on the East coast of the
                United States and a few on the West Coast but I haven't been able to visit many western mountain states.
                Travelling to other countries is also something I'd like to do more, and I've actually spent a semester
                of college in Melbourne, Australia! That was an experience I'll never forget and definitely want to go
                back some day. My next goal, however, is to visit the United Kingdom. I have some friends over there I'd
                like to go see and get some proper fish and chips (and maybe some Nando's). </p>
